This is a simple Python program that predicts the probability of a child having (e.g) cheek dimples based on the genotypes of both parents. To use the program, simply run the gene_prob.py file on a Python environment (Python 3 or higher). The program will ask you to enter the genotypes of the mother and father using 'D' to represent the dominant allele and 'd' to represent the recessive allele. Only enter genotype combinations consisting of these two letters as arguments, such as 'Dd' or 'dd'. Based on the parental genotypes, the program will then predict the probability of the child having cheek dimples, with different probabilities for each genotype combination. The output will either indicate that the child will not have cheek dimples or that it is uncertain, along with the associated probability percentage.
